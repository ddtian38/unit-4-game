Star Wars RPG

Star Wars RPG allows the user to select a character and attack another character. As a hero attacks a villian, the hero's attack increases based on assigned base power. Once the first villian dies, the player has the option to select another villian to fight. 

If the hero losses, the player can choose to restart game.
